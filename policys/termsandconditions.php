                <h5>1. Information about us and how to get in touch</h5>
                
                <h6>1.1 About us</h6>
                <p>We are Switchboo Ltd, a registered company in England & Wales (12303670) with our registered address at Kemp House, 160 City Road, London, EC1V 2NX.</p>
                
                <h6>1.2 How to contact us</h6>
                <p>You can contact our team by emailing hello@switchboo.com</p>
                
                <h5>2. The Switchboo Service</h5>
                
                <h6>2.1 Our service takes the hassle out of energy switching by automatically switching your supply to the best deal we can find when your fixed tariff comes to an end, but we may switch you before then if you’re on a variable tariff.</h6>
                
                <h6>2.2 The Switchboo Service is free of charge. We are paid a commission from the suppliers for switching you. Our service is completely impartial and the commissions we receive will never impact the switches we make. We will always switch you to the cheapest deal we can find from the selection of suppliers that we work with.</h6>
                
                
                <h6>2.3 In the event of signing up, you will be asked to enter your email address and postcode on our website which will automatically register you as a Switchboo customer. We will send important notifications about your switch to the email address you provide.</h6>
                
                
                <h6>2.4 In the event of a switch, we will notify you via email and provide details about your new energy supplier and any savings that are made. You will be given a 14 day cooling off period where you may cancel the switch if you change your mind. If you cancel outside of this period you may occur exit fees from the supplier that we have switched you to. We will store the information you have provided and automatically rerun the switching process again for you on your behalf.</h6>
                
                
                
                <h6>2.4 To carry out the Switchboo Service you grant us permission to switch your energy supply for you, arrange your switch and create legal relationships with the supplier we or you have selected. We will share information about you with energy suppliers and our partners.</h6>
                
                
                <h5>3. Our contract with you</h5>
                
                <h6>3.1 Our contract</h6>
                <p>When you sign up to use the Switchboo Service, we will provide the service under these terms and conditions.</p>
                
                <h6>3.2 We don’t supply your energy, we just provide the switching service.</h6>
                
                <h6>3.3 When we switch you to a new energy tariff, you will enter into a separate contract with the energy supplier and our job pauses until your next switch.</h6>
                
                <h6>3.4 The energy supplier is responsible for completing the switch and communicating with your existing supplier. We are not responsible for your energy suppliers contract with you and we recommend that you read your energy supplier’s terms and conditions carefully. Our terms and conditions only apply to the Switchboo Service. </h6>
                
                <h6>3.4 We will alert you if we cannot accept you as a customer or complete a switch for you.</h6>

                <h5>4. Using the Switchboo Service</h5>
                <h6>4.1 Whilst you are a customer of Switchboo you must not:</h6>
                <p>4.1.1 cancel your energy directly with your energy supplier, you must tell us if you move house;</p>
                <p>4.1.2 switch your energy independently or change your tariff as this obstructs the Switchboo Service and may expose you to early exit fees;</p>
                <p>4.1.3 cancel a switch we have arranged without informing us; or</p>
                <p>4.1.4 designate anyone else to perform a service the same as or similar to the Switchboo Service.</p>
                
                <p>Please contact us immediately in the event of wanting to do any of these things listed above. If you do not, Switchboo may continue to switch your energy for you.</p>
                
                
                <h6>4.2 Please get in touch with your energy supplier if you have switched and not heard from them within 7 days. You should also contact your new energy supplier if you experience any issues with the switch.</h6>
                
                
                <h6>4.3 You must be the bill payer or have the bill payer’s permission to use the Switchboo Service.</h6>
                
                <h5>5. The information you provide</h5>
                
                
                <h6>5.1 The Switchboo Service operates best when you provide us with correct information. You must ensure that the information you provide is accurate so that any quotes that we provide will be correct. You must update us if any of the information you have provided changes. It’s extremely important that you tell us about any changes in your household’s energy consumption. We will not be held responsible for any loss or damage caused when we execute the Switchboo Service.</h6>
                
                
                <h5>6. The information we provide and the switch</h5>
                
                <h6>6.1 The tariffs we offer may only be available at the date and time the information is provided. New tariffs may become available before or after the switch takes place and the Switchboo Service will not take those into account.</h6>
                
                <h6>6.2 We will try our best to make sure that the information we provide you is correct and up to date. Please note that tariffs and rates may change rapidly and without any notice. This means that when you have switched, the supplier could change their tariff or rate (but they don’t usually do this if you have switched to a fixed rate plan).</h6>
                
                <h6>6.3 We work with a wide panel of suppliers that offer both good customer service and competitive tariffs. When we offer you tariffs and suppliers, we do not include the whole energy market. This means that we may not switch you to the absolute cheapest tariff but we will always make sure that you’re with a great energy supplier. The savings that are shown on our website is the money that you could save by switching to the new tariff and it’s compared against your existing tariff.</h6>
